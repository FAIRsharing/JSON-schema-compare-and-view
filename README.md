# JSON-schema-compare-and-view

The JSONschema-compare-and-view is an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) web application that takes as input the
output from the [jsonldschema](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/jsonldschema) python package comparator and 
allows to visualise them in the browser. The comparison is based on the semantic annotations provided in JSON-LD context files associated with the JSON-schemas being compared.

This demonstrator includes comparisons between the reporting guidelines represented with Machine-Actionable Metadata Models available in the [Minimum Information Requirement catalogue repository](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/mircat).

For example, see the output generated for comparing MIACME and MIACA here: https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-compare-and-view/?target=inputs/MIACA_VS_MIACME.json
